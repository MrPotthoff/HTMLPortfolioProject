    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>Things I do, I do right. May it be in my studies of Psychology or in my own private company which I run with some friends of mine...</p>
        
    <p>My passion definitely lies in thinking about people. That is why I chose to study Psychology in the first place. And now that technology has gotten greater and greater influence over the time I started minding about its ways to connect to the people. Other passions of mine are sports, politics and fashion. Last of which is the reason why friends and I founded a sneakers platform which is soon to be published.</p>
        
    <p>To better be able to understand the connection and to combine all of these interestes I now started to learn programming. It is an eager goal but I feel like I am on a good way to at least gain a moderate understanding of the processes and the interactions of the different coding languages. This will not only help me to be more succesful with my own company or in my ambitions of making technology and people connect on a higher level, no it will also sharpen my perception and logical thinking.</p>
